# OpenLucius
OpenLucius is a lean and fast social productivity platform, based on Drupal; implemented as an installation profile / distribution. The goal is to be easy-to-use software that helps your people to communicate better, manage knowledge, build culture, get projects done, share and manage (large) files, and more.

Goal is also to create an optimal developer experience for building add-on modules and easy management / updates.
